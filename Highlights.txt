- We present a study on the adaptation of the island sizes of a distributed Evolutionary Algorithm to the computational power of the nodes of an heterogeneous cluster.
- Three problems with different characteristics and computational demands (MMDP, OneMax and Rosenbrock Shifted Function), with different lengths, have been used to give an insight of the effects of this proposal.
- Two different hardware systems have been compared: an homogeneous and an heterogeneous cluster.
- A scalability study has been performed using 4 and 8 nodes in both clusters.
- As a first step, we have adapted (offline) population sizes proportionally to the attained generations to obtain the optimum with the same population size in all islands.
- We also have adapted the population size during runtime (online) comparing with the current number of generations of the neighbours of the topology.
- Both adaptation schemes use the algorithm performance for calibration, and not artificial benchmarks.
- Results show that adapting (online and offline) the population sizes to the computational power of the nodes of a heterogeneous cluster can decrease time to obtain the optimum solution.
- These results aim to research in automatic procedures to perform this population size adjustment dynamically, according to both, the problem and the computational characteristics of each node.
